## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
Much of my work is now private -- company rules, not mine -- but feel free to browse some of my older bootcamp projects. 

### xptracker
For the past year or so, I've been working on bringing a product idea I've had to life. It's an idea I had ever since I made my first personal portfolio site (no longer live) that helps job seekers manage and dynamically create resumes tailored to each role being applied to. It's called "xptracker" and a preview landing page is available at:

[xptracker.app](https://www.xptracker.app)

We are currently working on testing and refining our MVP, before allowing user sign ups; however, if you're interested in the general concept, a fully workable demo is available on the landing page!
